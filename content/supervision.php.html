			<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>It is where a supervisor and supervisee set a contract to work together towards developing the competence of the supervisee in the context of the helping work that they perform.
The professional aims include a duty of care for both the supervisee and their client in the work they do together.</p>

<h2>Who needs it?</h2>

<p>Supervision is compulsory for those who work as registered counsellors and psychotherapists. It is part of the ethical principles we all agree to abide by as part of this <a href="http://www.bacp.co.uk/supervision/">professional status and membership</a></p>

<p>Supervision is also seen as part and parcel of good practice in coaching and other helping professions.</p>

<img src="../junefettes/images/supervision-middle.jpg" width="495" height="135" alt="supervision-middle" />

<h2>What does it do?</h2>

<p>Peter Hawkins and Robin Shohet 2007 <a href="junefettes/references.php.html">(Reference 8)</a> have produced a useful text about supervision in the helping professions. They explain how supervision has a number of functions, which include:</p>

<p>Education - helping the supervisee understand their client better and helping them become more aware of their own reactions and responses 
Supportive - helping the supervisee deal with any reactions to distressing material Managerial - this is about taking responsibility with the supervisee to ensure that the ethical standards of the profession are maintained.</p>

<h2>My approach</h2>

<p>I have undertaken professional training with the <a href="http://www.sihr.org.uk/">Scottish Institute of Human Relations (SIHR)</a> and am particularly interested in what takes place beneath the surface of the relationship that the consultant or counsellor has with their client.  The organisational context within which the work is taking place is of direct relevance to the work.  It is therefore a systems approach to supervision.</p>

<p>Therefore, taking into consideration the context of the work, I encourage my supervisee to ask questions of themselves about any underlying assumptions they are making that may prevent the work moving forward.  It is about helping draw their attention to any material that is, unknown to them, being avoided.</p>

<p>This can only take place within a relationship of trust and respect and building this relationship is an important part of the supervisory relationship so that it becomes a safe place to raise concerns and say the unspeakable.</p>

<h2>What I offer</h2>

<p>For counsellors, psychotherapists, psychologists and other individuals involved in the helping professions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Psychodynamically informed supervision on a one-to-one basis </li>
<li>Group psychodynamic supervision </li>
</ul>
