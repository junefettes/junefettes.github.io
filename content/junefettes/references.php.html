<p>Research into the impact of mergers and acquisitions suggests that</p>

<p>'..people issues need to be managed as professionally as possible through a merger or acquisition...the human dimension of a M&amp;As (sic) is not a 'soft' intangible issue, but one that is 'hard' because if mismanaged, it can translate into lost creativity, lost energy and lost focus as key employees leave or become demoralised. Ultimately, these problems show in the balance sheet of an organisation. Perhaps they take the form of declining revenues and spiralling employment costs. More subtly, they may result in the loss of valued customers or even a weakening of brand identity! The investment community is beginning to look beyond the traditional methods of valuing a business. It is widely accepted that the book value of a business, based on its tangible assets, reflects only a fraction of its true value.'</p>

<p>P49</p>

<p>'It was in this area of culture and values that the research showed the biggest gap between how executives manage mergers and how employees perceive them. Some executives were very successful in role modelling a few key values related to both customers and employees through the transition period. From this nucleus of core values, something more comprehensive could be grown.'</p>

<p>P44-5</p>

<p>'The most uncomfortable lesson for senior executives is probably that the values and culture of the new organisation as perceived by staff, emerge from the way the transition itself has been managed. To announce a set of values a year of two after the a major merger will give the workforce a good laugh, but will be no replacement for having lived those values since the merger was announced.</p>
