			<h1>Are you considering executive coaching?</h1>

<p>The type of personal development coaching offers is frequently focused on specific cultural or performance objectives.  Executive coaching for leadership, team dynamics and work-life balance are examples of this.</p>

<p>Organisations or individuals may focus more generally on achieving enhanced managerial maturity.  In this case, creativity, adaptability and personal accountability may take centre stage.</p>

<p>There are, however, common denominators:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Overall business performance is dependent on the individuals and the system (i.e. the organisation and/or industry sector)</p></li>
<li><p>Motivation in the system, whether positive or negative, is governed by value-driven communications</p></li>
<li><p>Most communication in the system is not immediately available to conscious thought but is implicitly lived through the decisions and actions of individuals and teams.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="choosing-a-coach.php.html">Choosing a coach</a> or provider of coaching is an important stage in the <a href="process.php.html">coaching contacting process</a>.</p>

<p><a href="philosophy.php.html">Evidence</a> suggests that personal development through coaching releases the capacity for change.  By their very nature, implicit patterns of decision-making are not available to higher thought and choice.  Greater awareness of these introduces choice and accountability.</p>

<p>Coaching provides insight about personal impact: actual and desired.<br />
How coaching works is less clear though it is critical that the work is grounded and contained within a philosophical and/or theoretical <a href="philosophy.php.html">coaching framework</a>.</p>

<p>Important for organisations interested in the wider but less tangible aspects to the concept of governance, resilience within the system depends on underlying stress responses.  It is a slippery slope if key individuals are unable to act on their consciences.</p>

<p>An example of a coaching case can be found in this <a href="../../files/Case-Presentation.pdf">downloadable case study</a>.</p>
